# Text Classification Project

## Overview
This project is part of an AI and ML internship program and focuses on developing a text classification model that categorizes text data into predefined categories. The project uses various datasets and machine learning techniques to train, evaluate, and optimize the model's performance.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several components, each handling a specific part of the text classification pipeline:

- **Data Preprocessing:** This step involves cleaning and preparing the text data for model training, including tokenization, vectorization, and normalization.
- **Model Training:** Here, different machine learning models are trained using TensorFlow and Hugging Face Transformers. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in text categorization.
- **Evaluation:** The trained models are evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Integration:** The project integrates multiple datasets to enhance the model's ability to generalize across different text categories.

## Datasets
We used several datasets to train and evaluate the text classification model:

1. **AG News Classification Dataset:** A widely-used dataset for text classification tasks, containing news articles categorized into four classes.
2. **Reuters-21578 Dataset:** A dataset consisting of news documents, often used for text classification research.
3. **Reuters-21578 NLTK Dataset:** A version of the Reuters-21578 dataset, preprocessed using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for easier integration.
4. **Text Categorizing Dataset:** Another dataset provided to further improve the model's performance in categorizing text into various predefined classes.

## Installation
